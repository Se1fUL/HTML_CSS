<h1>The International</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>The International</strong>, often abbreviated as TI, is an annual tournament organized by Valve. In 2015 Valve increased their number of hosted events, founding the Dota Major Championships which incorporates The International into its structure. The International remains the biggest and most prestigious event on the Major Championship circuit.

  The first International was held in Cologne, Germany, during the trade show Gamescom, in order to unveil Dota 2 to worldwide audiences. It drew attention due to its staggering $1.6 million USD prize pool (with $1 million for the champion). 16 teams were invited to play for the title.

  In 2012 The International moved to Seattle, Washington. The prize pool remained at $1.6 million USD. Only 14 teams were invited; two additional slots were awarded to the winners of regional qualifiers.

  Since 2013, the Dota 2 community has been able to contribute to the prize pool. The total prize of The International 2013 grew to $2.8 million USD. The prize pool surpassed $10 million in 2014 and $20 million in 2016.

  In 2018, after six years in Seattle, The International was held in Vancouver, Canada. In 2019, The International was held in Shanghai, China, the prize pool surpassed $34 million, making it the largest prize pool for any single esports tournament until it was surpassed by The International 2020.

  The International 10 was originally scheduled to take place in Stockholm, Sweden in 2020, but was delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the event was relocated to take place in Bucharest, Romania due to potential problems with COVID-19 related restrictions in Sweden.</p>

<h2>The International 2021</h2>
<hr>
<p>The International 10 is the concluding tournament of the Dota Pro Circuit and the tenth annual edition of The International which returns to Europe for the first time since 2011. The invite format is similar to the format used for the preceding International, whereby a point system based on official sponsored Regional Leagues and Majors will be used to determine the teams invited to The International.

  The tournament was originally scheduled to be held from August 18th to 23rd, 2020 in Avicii Arena in Stockholm, Sweden. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Valve delayed the event to 2021 tentatively. Valve later announced that the event will take place on August 5th to 15th, 2021. However, due to issue with hosting the tournament in Sweden, Valve announced the tournament will take place from October 7th to 17th in Arena Națională in Bucharest, Romania.</p>
